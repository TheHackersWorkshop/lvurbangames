# Thank You and a Vision for What's Next

First, thank you to everyone who has taken the time to explore and clone my GitHub repositories.

As many of you have seen, I’ve been in the process of open-sourcing all of my past work. I want to say these projects were never just about making money—they were about the design, the engineering, and sharing the creative process with others.

Before I had to close Reimagined Innovations, I was actively developing an expansion to the *Las Vegas Urban Games* project: a fully offline **Choose Your Own Adventure** system.

### Imagine this:

A public park or open space transformed into a live-action fantasy world.

- The pond becomes a storybook lake.  
- The trees mark the edges of an enchanted forest.  
- At each station, players encounter a narrative choice:

> *"Do you take the path into the woods, or cross the bridge by the lake?"*

Each choice point leads to the next ESP32 station, powered by its own microcontroller, hosting local web pages with story branches. No internet required. No external power beyond battery packs.

Or, for those wanting richer multimedia, each ESP32 could optionally redirect to online content—animations, sound, or video. Both options are possible.

If you're one of the many who cloned **LVUrbanGames**, this CYOA mechanic can be implemented with only a few changes. The foundation is already there.

The idea was—and still is—to turn **ordinary places into extraordinary experiences**.

If this sparks ideas for your community, classroom, or creative tech project, I hope you build something amazing with it.

**What would *you* add to the app?**  
Feel free to open an issue, fork the repo, or share your thoughts.
